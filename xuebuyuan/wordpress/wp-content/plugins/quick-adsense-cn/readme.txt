English:
**Quick Adsense** is an Ads management Wordpress plugin. It offers a quicker & flexible way to insert Adsense or any Ads code into a blog post. Besides, it can randomly place the Ads anywhere within a post. It comes with a simple setting page, and it does not overwhelm you with complicated customizable options. 

In general, placing Adsense randomly within a post is a good way to experiment a variety of ads formats & placements besides optimizing your Adsense. If you have many regular visitors who frequently revisit your blog, the **randomization** will likely catch their attention.

Here are some **features** that come with this plugin:

1. Absolutely NO author revenue reward or revenue sharing from your Adsense or that kind of features.
1. Default Ads positioning: Assign Ads to the beginning of post, assign Ads to the middle of post, assign Ads to the end of post, assign Ads after certain paragraphs (3 options available) & assign Ads after certain images.
1. Flexible Ads placement, insert Ads specifically or randomly anywhere within a post.
1. Simple configuration interface, requires no coding knowledge: Just copy and paste AdSense code, tick & select options, the plugin will then do the rest for you.  
1. Support any Ads code, not limited to Adsense code only.
1. Display up to a maximum of 10 Ads on a page. Google allows publishers to place up to 3 Adsense for Content on a page. If you are using other Ads, you may display up to 10 Ads.
1. Support up to a maximum of 10 Ads codes on Sidebar Widgets.
1. Support up to a maximum of 10 Ads codes for specific placement & randomization within a post.
1. Ads placement on the fly, simply insert &lt;!--Ads1--&gt;, &lt;!--Ads2--&gt; ... , &lt;!--RndAds--&gt;, &lt;!--NoAds--&gt;, &lt;!--OffDef--&gt; to a post to accomplish this.
1. Tags above can be inserted into a post easily via the additional Quicktag Buttons added to the HTML Edit Post SubPanel.

Sign up for a [Google Adsense Account](http://adsense.google.com/) to generate revenue from your blog, if you don't have one.
